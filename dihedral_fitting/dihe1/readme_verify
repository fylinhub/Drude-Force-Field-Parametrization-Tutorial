A. Use the same "initialize" file as that for autofitting

"CD2R6A   CD2R6A   CD2R6A   CLDR1" corresponds to c4-c5-c6-cl dihedral
"HDR6A    CD2R6A   CD2R6A   CLDR1" corresponds to h5-c5-c6-cl dihedral

B. Prepare a allscan_drude.inp; copy allscan_drude_lsfitpar.inp to allscan_drude.inp; and stream the toppar files with predicted dihedral parameters ( see toppar_drude_verify_lsfitpar.str)

C. do 'initialize', then run charmn:
   ./initialize
   charmm < allscan_drude.inp > allscan_drude.out 

  # It will also generate  ini_geom.pdb (qm)  and fin_geom.pdb (mm)

D. Use scanplot to get the dihedral qm and mm using the predicted parameters:
   ./scanplot -i test scan_chlb.qme scan_chlb.mme

  # The scan_chlb.qme is from the *.e_file
  # cat  ../scan_h5c5c6cl/chlb_h5c5c6cl.e_file > scan_chlb.qme
  # If you have more dihedral scanned results, you need to copy all of then in the *.qme in the same order as you assign 'peses' in allscan_drude_lsfitpar.inp 

Usage:
1. ./initialize 
2. charmm < allscan_drude.inp > allscan_drude.out 
3. ./scanplot -i [output_plot_name] scan_[resi].qme scan_[resi].mme
# It will generate scan[[output_plot_name]]*.gpt so that you can just use it to generate the plot.

Example commands:
 ./initialize 
 charmm < allscan_drude.inp > allscan_drude.out 
 ./scanplot -i test scan_chlb.qme scan_chlb.mme
